# New York CitiBike Project Analysis
Project analysis, using python to create an interactive dashboard, analyzing trip data and weather temperature to better understand user behavior, seasonal demand patterns, and geographical inventory distribution to better improve customer experience and provide more bike availability to solve customer complaints regarding bike inventory.
## Objective
The project aims to diagnose distribution inefficiencies in Citi Bike's New York City network by analyzing 2022 trip data and temperature weather patterns to study user behavior to address user complaints regarding bike ride share inventory issues. Through descriptive analysis and geographic visualizations, the project analyses customer usage patterns, seasonal rides, pinpoints logistical challenges, and provided actionable recommendations to optimize station distribution, manage seasonal demand, reduce customer dissatisfaction, and support strategic decisions 
## Key Questions
1) Which bike stations see the most frequented trip usage?
2) During which season(s) do users most often use ride share services?
3) Does temperature affect rides and at what temperatures do riders show a major drop in usage? What temperatures show a peak in ride share usage?
4) What areas of New York show the most number of trips taken by riders?
